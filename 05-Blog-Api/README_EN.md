# Chapter 5: Blog API

Our next project is a `Blog API` using the full set of `Django REST Framework` features. It will have
users, permissions, and allow for full CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) functionality. We’ll also
explore viewsets, routers, and documentation.


In this chapter we will build the basic API section. Just as with our Library and Todo APIs, we
start with traditional Django and then add in Django REST Framework. The main difference is
that our API endpoints will support CRUD from the beginning which, as we will see, Django REST
Framework makes quite seamless to do.


### Initial Set Up
  
Our set up is the same as before. Navigate into our code directory and within it create one for
this project called blogapi . Then install Django in a new virtual environment create a new Django
project ( config ) and app for blog entries ( posts ).

  
<div dir="ltr">
  
Command Line

```shell
$ cd ~/Desktop && cd code
$ mkdir blogapi && cd blogapi
$ pipenv install django~=3.1.0
$ pipenv shell
(blogapi) $ django-admin startproject config .
(blogapi) $ python manage.py startapp posts
```
  
</div>
  
 
Since we’ve added a new app we need to tell Django about it. So make sure to add posts to our
list of `INSTALLED_APPS` in the `config/settings.py` file.
  
  
<div dir="ltr">
  
Code

```python
# config/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    # Local
    'posts', # new
]

```
  
</div>
  
  
Now run migrate for the first time to sync our database with Django’s default settings and the
new app.
  
<div dir="ltr">

Command Line
```shell
(blogapi) $ python manage.py migrate
```
  
</div>
  
  
  
### Model
  
Our database model will have five fields: author , title , body , created_at , and updated_at . We
can use Django’s built-in User model as the author provided we import it on the second line from
the top.
  
  
  
<div dir="ltr">

Code
```python
# posts/models.py
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
  
  
class Post(models.Model):
    author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    body = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
  
    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```  
  
</div>  
  
  
Note that we’re also defining what the __str__ representation of the model should be which is
a Django best practice. This way we will see the title in our Django admin later.
  
Now update our database by first creating a new migration file and then running migrate to sync
the database with our model changes.
  
<div dir="ltr">
  
Command Line
```shell
(blogapi) $ python manage.py makemigrations posts
Migrations for 'posts':
  posts/migrations/0001_initial.py
    - Create model Post
(blogapi) $ python manage.py migrate
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, posts, sessions
Running migrations:
  Applying posts.0001_initial... OK
```

</div>
  
  
Good! We want to view our data in Django’s excellent built-in admin app so let’s add it to
posts/admin.py as follows.  

  
  
<div dir="ltr">

Code
```python
# posts/admin.py
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Post
  
admin.site.register(Post)
```
  
</div>
  
Then create a superuser account so we can access the admin. Type the command below and
enter all the prompts.
  

<div dir="ltr">
  
Command Line
```shell
(blogapi) $ python manage.py createsuperuser
```

</div>

Now we can start up the local web server.
  



<div dir="ltr">
  
Command Line
```shell
(blogapi) $ python manage.py runserver
```

</div>
  
  
Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ and log in with your superuser credentials. Click on
the “+ Add” button next to Posts and create a new blog post. Next to “Author” will be a dropdown
menu that has your superuser account (mine is called wsv ). Make sure an author is selected. Add
a title and body content then click on the “Save” button.
  
  
![Admin add blog post](https://github.com/ftg-iran/dfa-persian/blob/main/05-Blog-Api/https://github.com/ftg-iran/dfa-persian/blob/main/06-Permissions/images/1.png)
  
  
You will be redirected to the Posts page which displays all existing blog posts.

### Tests
 
Let’s write a basic test for our Post model. We want to ensure a logged-in user can create a blog
post with a title and body.
  
  
  
<div dir="ltr">

Code
```python
# posts/tests.py
from django.test import TestCase
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from .models import Post
  
  
class BlogTests(TestCase):
  
    @classmethod
    def setUpTestData(cls):
        # Create a user
        testuser1 = User.objects.create_user(
            username='testuser1', password='abc123')
        testuser1.save()
  
        # Create a blog post
        test_post = Post.objects.create(
            author=testuser1, title='Blog title', body='Body content...')
        test_post.save()
  
    def test_blog_content(self):
        post = Post.objects.get(id=1)
        author = f'{post.author}'
        title = f'{post.title}'
        body = f'{post.body}'
        self.assertEqual(author, 'testuser1')
        self.assertEqual(title, 'Blog title')
        self.assertEqual(body, 'Body content...')
```
  
</div>
  
  
To confirm that our tests are working quit the local server Control+c . Then run our tests.
  
  
<div dir="ltr">
  
Command Line
```shell
(blogapi) $ python manage.py test
```

</div>
  
  
You should see output like the following which confirms everything is working as expected.
  
  
<div dir="ltr">
  
Command Line
```shell
(blogapi) $ python manage.py test
Creating test database for alias 'default'...
System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.105s
  
OK
Destroying test database for alias 'default'...
```

</div>
  
  
We are done now with the regular Django part of our API. All we really need is a model and some
data in our database. Now it’s time to add Django REST Framework to take care of transforming
our model data into an API.
  
  
### Django REST Framework
  
As we have seen before, Django REST Framework takes care of the heavy lifting of transforming
our database models into a RESTful API. There are three main steps to this process:
  
- urls.py file for the URL routes
- serializers.py file to transform the data into JSON
- views.py file to apply logic to each API endpoint
  
  
  
On the command line use pipenv to install Django REST Framework.
  
<div dir="ltr">
  
Command Line
```shell
(blogapi) $ pipenv install djangorestframework~=3.11.0
```

</div>
  
  
Then add it to the INSTALLED_APPS section of our config/settings.py file. It’s also a good idea
to explicitly set our permissions which by default in Django REST Framework are configured to
AllowAny . We will update these in the next chapter.
  
  
<div dir="ltr">

Code
```python
# config/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',

    # 3rd-party apps
    'rest_framework', # new

    # Local
    'posts.apps.PostsConfig',
]
  
# new
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.permissions.AllowAny',
    ]
}
```
  
</div>
  
  
Now we need to create our URLs, views, and serializers.
  
  
### URLs
  
Let’s start with the URL routes for the actual location of the endpoints. Update the project-level
`urls.py` file with the include import on the second line and a new api/v1/ route for our posts
app.

  
<div dir="ltr">

Code
```python
# config/urls.py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path # new

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('api/v1/', include('posts.urls')), # new
]
```
  
</div>

  
It is a good practice to always version your APIs— v1/ , v2/ , etc—since when you make a large
change there may be some lag time before various consumers of the API can also update. That
way you can support a v1 of an API for a period of time while also launching a new, updated v2
and avoid breaking other apps that rely on your API back-end.
  
  
Note that since our only app at this point is posts we can include it directly here. If we had
multiple apps in a project it might make more sense to create a dedicated api app and then
include all the other API url routes into it. But for basic projects like this one, I prefer to avoid an
api app that is just used for routing. We can always add one later, if needed.
  
  
Next create our posts app `urls.py` file.

  
<div dir="ltr">
  
Command Line
```shell
(blogapi) $ touch posts/urls.py
```

</div>
  
  
And then include the code below.
  
<div dir="ltr">

Code
```python
# posts/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import PostList, PostDetail
  
urlpatterns = [
    path('<int:pk>/', PostDetail.as_view()),
    path('', PostList.as_view()),
]
```
  
</div>
  
  
All blog routes will be at api/v1/ so our PostList view (which we’ll write shortly) has the empty
string '' will be at api/v1/ and the PostDetail view (also to be written) at api/v1/# where #
represents the primary key of the entry. For example, the first blog post has a primary id of 1 so
it will be at the route api/v1/1 , the second post at api/v1/2 , and so on.
  
  
  
### Serializers

Now for our serializers. Create a new `serializers.py` file in our posts app.
  
<div dir="ltr">
  
Command Line
```shell
(blogapi) $ touch posts/serializers.py
```

</div>
  
  
The serializer not only transforms data into JSON, it can also specify which fields to include or
exclude. In our case, we will include the id field Django automatically adds to database models
but we will exclude the updated_at field by not including it in our fields .

  
The ability to include/exclude fields in our API this easily is a remarkable feature. More often
than not, an underlying database model will have far more fields than what needs to be exposed.
Django REST Framework’s powerful serializer class makes it extremely straightforward to control
this.
  
  
<div dir="ltr">

Code
```python
# posts/serializers.py
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Post
  
class PostSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
  
    class Meta:
        fields = ('id', 'author', 'title', 'body', 'created_at',)
        model = Post
```
  
</div>
  
  
At the top of the file we have imported Django REST Framework’s serializers class and our
own models. Then we created a PostSerializer and added a Meta class where we specified
which fields to include and explicitly set the model to use. There are many ways to customize a
serializer but for common use cases, such as a basic blog, this is all we need.
  
 
### Views
  
The final step is to create our views. Django REST Framework has several generic views that
are helpful. We have already used [ListAPIView](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/generic-views/#listapiview)
in both the Library and Todos APIs to create a
**read-only** endpoint collection, essentially a list of all model instances. In the Todos API we also
used [RetrieveAPIView](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/generic-views/#retrieveapiview)
for a **read-only** single endpoint, which is analogous to a detail view in
traditional Django.


For our Blog API we want to list all available blog posts as a read-write endpoint which means
using [ListCreateAPIView](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/generic-views/#listcreateapiview) ,
which is similar to the ListAPIView we’ve used previously but allows
for writes. We also want to make the individual blog posts available to be read, updated, or
deleted. And sure enough, there is a built-in generic Django REST Framework view just for this
purpose: [RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/generic-views/#retrieveupdatedestroyapiview).
That’s what we’ll use here.

Update the `views.py` file as follows.
  
  
<div dir="ltr">

Code
```python
# posts/views.py
from rest_framework import generics
from .models import Post
from .serializers import PostSerializer
  
  
class PostList(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    queryset = Post.objects.all()
    serializer_class = PostSerializer
  
  
class PostDetail(generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView):
    queryset = Post.objects.all()
    serializer_class = PostSerializer
  
```
  
</div>
 
  
At the top of the file we import generics from Django REST Framework as well as our models
and serializers files. Then we create two views. PostList uses the generic ListCreateAPIView
while PostDetail uses the RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView .
  
 
It’s pretty amazing that all we have to do is update our generic view to radically change the
behavior of a given API endpoint. This is the advantage of using a full-featured framework like
Django REST Framework: all of this functionality is available, tested, and just works. As developers
we do not have to reinvent the wheel here.
  

Phew. Our API is now complete and we really did not have to write much code on our own. We
will make additional improvements to our API in the coming chapters but it is worth appreciating
that it already performs the basic list and CRUD functionality we desire. Time to test things out
with the Django Rest Framework’s browsable API.
  

### Browsable API

Start up the local server to interact with our API.
  

<div dir="ltr">
  
Command Line
```shell
(blogapi) $ python manage.py runserver
```

</div>
  
Then go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/ to see the Post List endpoint.

![API Post List](https://github.com/ftg-iran/dfa-persian/blob/main/05-Blog-Api/https://github.com/ftg-iran/dfa-persian/blob/main/06-Permissions/images/3.png)
  
  
The page displays a list of our blog posts—just one at the moment—in JSON format. Note that
both GET and POST methods are allowed.
  
  
Now let’s confirm that our model instance endpoint—which relates to a single post rather than
a list of all posts—exists.
  
  
Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/1/ .
  
![API Post Detail](https://github.com/ftg-iran/dfa-persian/blob/main/05-Blog-Api/https://github.com/ftg-iran/dfa-persian/blob/main/06-Permissions/images/4.png)
  
  
You can see in the header that GET , PUT , PATCH , and DELETE are supported but not POST . And in
fact you can use the HTML form below to make changes or even use the red “DELETE” button
to delete the instance.
  
  
Let’s try things out. Update our title with the additional text (edited) at the end. Then click
on the “PUT” button.
  
![API Post Detail edited](https://github.com/ftg-iran/dfa-persian/blob/main/05-Blog-Api/https://github.com/ftg-iran/dfa-persian/blob/main/06-Permissions/images/5.png)

Go back to the Post List view by clicking on the link for it at the top of the page or navigating
directly to http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/ and you can see the updated text there as well.
  
![API Post List edited](https://github.com/ftg-iran/dfa-persian/blob/main/05-Blog-Api/https://github.com/ftg-iran/dfa-persian/blob/main/06-Permissions/images/6.png)
  
  
  
  
### Conclusion

Our Blog API is completely functional at this point. However there is a big problem: anyone can
update or delete an existing blog post! In other words, we do not have any permissions in place.
In the next chapter we will learn how to apply permissions to protect our API.
